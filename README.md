Computational solutions for the Donaldson geometric flow
========================================================

This is a research project to study Donaldson's geometric flow on the space of
symplectic structures by means of computational solutions. In particular, I use
PINN's (physically informed neural networks) to approximate geometric quantities
arising in the flow. The hope is to gain a better intuition on the existence
of critical points, singularities and the structure of the space of symplectic
forms.

An overview of Donaldson's geometric flow on the space of symplectic structures
can be found [here](https://content.intlpress.com/journal/JSG/article/4226/info).
